              <p>
                People from Google approached us this January with offer to
                create new neural network for whole Google's ecosystem. This
                idea was very interesting and looked almost impossible at first
                glance. However, our engineers proved their expertise and built
                amazing autonomous platform.

                For a years, since founding days of a company, Apple always
                worked with its own operating system. In October, this was about
                to change. Our company got chance to rewrite the history by
                creating brand new OS for Apple. It was very difficult and all
                our employees worked hard every day.
